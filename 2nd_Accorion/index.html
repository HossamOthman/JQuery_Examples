                <p>JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)</p>

            <div class="faq-item__content">
                <p>JavaScript is a scripting language used to develop web pages. Developed in Netscape, JS allows developers to create a dynamic and interactive web page to interact with visitors and execute complex actions. It also enables users to load content into a document without reloading the entire page.</p>

            <h3 class="faq-item__title">What is JavaScript function?</h3>
            <div class="faq-item__content">
                <p>A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedureâ€”a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output.</p>

            <h3 class="faq-item__title">What is a class in JavaScript?</h3>
            <div class="faq-item__content">
                <p>Classes are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data. Classes in JS are built on prototypes but also have some syntax and semantics that are unique to classes. For more examples and explanations, see the Using classes guide.</p>
